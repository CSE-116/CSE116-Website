                    There are not testing requirements for this programming task. Instead, the tests are provided for
                    you in the tests.TestClasses1 class. All of the tests are commented out since the code they test
                    does not exist which would prevent your project from compiling. As you complete parts of the
                    project, you should uncomment the corresponding tests and run this test class to check your
                    functionality. (You can highlight several lines of code and press command+/ on mac or
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45432031/intellij-shortcut-to-comment-line">
                        ctrl+shift+/ on Windows</a> to comment/uncomment all highlighted lines)
                </p>

                <p>
                    You will be writing your own tests for most/all future tasks. You should use these tests as an
                    example of how to approach testing your code.

                    Implement the following three classes with all of the listed functionality:
                </p>


                <ul>
                    <li>ratings.Song - In the ratings package, create a class named Song
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This class will have a constructor that takes 3 parameters in this order:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A String representing the title of the Song</li>
                                    <li>A String representing the artist of the Song</li>
                                    <li>A String representing the Songs ID</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implement getter and setter methods for the three constructor parameters named:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>getTitle</li>
                                    <li>setTitle</li>
                                    <li>getArtist</li>
                                    <li>setArtist</li>
                                    <li>getSongID <-- Note that both characters in ID are capital</li>
                                    <li>setSongID</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For this task, you don't need to implement any additional methods in the Song class.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>ratings.Rating - In the ratings package, create a class named Rating
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This class will have a constructor that takes 2 parameters in this order:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A String representing the ID of the reviewer who gave the rating</li>
                                    <li>An int representing the rating that the reviewer gave</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implement getter and setter methods for the two constructor parameters named:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>getReviewerID</li>
                                    <li>setReviewerID</li>
                                    <li>getRating</li>
                                    <li>setRating</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ratings must be in the range 1-5. If someone calls setRatings with an invalid rating,
                                the rating should be set to -1 to indicate that an error has occurred.
                                (eg. setRating(100) should result in the rating being set to -1)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It is good practice to have your constructor call your setter methods. If your
                                constructor calls setRating, you only have to write code that checks for invalid ratings
                                once and call that code whenever needed.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>ratings.Reviewer - In the ratings package, create a class named Reviewer
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This class will have a constructor that takes 1 parameter:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A String representing the ID of the reviewer</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implement getter and setter methods for the constructor parameter named:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>getReviewerID</li>
                                    <li>setReviewerID</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Implement a method named rateSong that takes an int as a parameter and returns a new
                                Rating object with this reviewer's ID and the rating from the parameter.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>



                </ul>

                <hr/>
                <p>
                    Since the tests are provided for you in this task, there is only one phase of AutoLab feedback.
                </p>

                    <li>Running my tests on Your Solution
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                AutoLab will run my tests against your code to check
                                it for correctness. If you are running, and passing, the provided tests before
                                submitting, you should pass all the tests in AutoLab.
                            </li>

                <p>
                    Once you passed the tests, you will have completed this Task and AutoLab will confirm this
                    with a score of 1 for complete.
