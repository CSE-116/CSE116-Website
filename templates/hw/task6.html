                <p>
                    There are no additional testing requirements for this task. Use the tests you wrote in programming
                    task 4 (In the TestDataStructures2 class) to help you debug your code in this task. You are
                    encouraged to write more than the tests that were required for task 4 to help you implement the
                    rest of the functionality for this task. You may find that even writing code that passes your
                    tests is not enough to earn credit for this task.

                    The code in this task will rely on several classes that we saw in lecture. Add the following
                    classes to your project to set up for this task:
                </p>


                <ul>
                    <li>Copy the code for a BinaryTreeNode into your ratings.datastructures package. The is code
                        provided here for convenience.
                    </li>
                    <li>An object of this type will be returned by one of your methods and will be tested in AutoLab.
                    All these methods must exist and be named exactly as they are here or there will be errors during
                        grading. It's recommended that you copy this code to avoid potential issues</li>
                </ul>

                <pre><code class="java">package ratings.datastructures;

public class BinaryTreeNode&lt;A> {
    private A value;
    private BinaryTreeNode&lt;A> left;
    private BinaryTreeNode&lt;A> right;

    public BinaryTreeNode(A value,BinaryTreeNode&lt;A> left,BinaryTreeNode&lt;A> right){
        this.value=value;
        this.right=right;
        this.left=left;
    }

    public A getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(A value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    }
}
</code></pre>



                <p>
                    Create a Playlist class in the ratings package with the following functionality. This class will
                    use a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store a playlist of Songs in sorted order.
                </p>


                <ul>
                    <li>A constructor that takes a Comparator of Songs
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You will use this Comparator in BST to sort the Songs of the Playlist. You should
                                create any instance variables you'll need when this constructor is called
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>



                    <li>A method named addSong that takes a reference to a Song and returns void
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This method will add the Song to the Playlist by inserting it into a BST with the
                                comparator from the constructor
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Note that you are allowed to use the BST code provided in lecture
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>A method named getSongTree that takes no parameters and returns the
                        ratings.datastructures.BinaryTreeNode of Songs that is the root node of your BST
                    </li>




                    <li>A method named getSongList that takes a BinaryTreeNode of Songs as a parameter and returns a
                        ratings.datastructures.LinkedListNode of Songs
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This method traverses the tree from the parameter and returns all the Songs in the tree
                                in a Linked List in sorted order (Assuming the parameter is the root of a BST)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Note: This method is expected to contain the majority of the difficulty of this task
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You should write the next method before this one
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>


                    <li>A method named getSongList that takes no parameters and returns a
                        ratings.datastructures.LinkedListNode of Songs
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This method traverses your BST and returns all the Songs in the tree
                                in a Linked List in sorted order
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This method should be one line since you can call your other getSongList method with
                                the root of your BST as the argument
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This is the method that you tested in task 4. You should write this method while
                                writing the other getSongList method so you can run your tests and utilize the debugger
                                while writing your code
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    Since the tests are provided for you in this task, there is only one phase of AutoLab feedback.

                                AutoLab will run my tests against your code to check
                                it for correctness. If you are running, and passing, the provided tests before
                                submitting, you should pass all the tests in AutoLab.

                <p>
                    Once you passed the tests, you will have completed this Task and AutoLab will confirm this
