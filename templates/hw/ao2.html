            First Application Objective - Constructor and Net Gains
        </h3>

        <hr/>
        <p>
            Test and implement the constructor and <code>netGains</code> methods in the
            <code>money.DebtCalculator</code> class.
        </p>

        <h5>
            Testing Requirements
        </h5>

        <p>
            Test the following features of your <code>money.DebtCalculator</code> class:
        </p>


        <ul>
            <li>
                A constructor that takes a filename as a <code>String</code> for a parameter. This will be a CSV file
                where
                each line is in the format "person1,person2,amount" meaning the person1 owes person2 the amount
                of dollars. All dollar values will be integers (Whole dollar amounts only). If a line is
                "Paul,Jesse,50" then Paul owes Jesse $50. The constructor will read this file and store all
                the debt information in instance variables. All CSV files should be in a directory named
                <code>data</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                A method named <code>netGains</code> that takes the name of a person as a <code>String</code> and
                returns the net gains
                for that person. This is the total amount that person will have gained after all debts are
                settled. Net gains can be negative. For example, if Paul owes Jesse $50 and Jesse owes Leo $75,
                then Jesse's net gains are -$25 and the method should return -25 as an int.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Second Application Objective - Detecting Cycles
        </h3>

        <hr/>
        <p>
            Test and implement the <code>findCycle</code> method in the <code>money.DebtCalculator</code> class.
        </p>

        <h5>
            Testing Requirements
        </h5>

        <p>
            Test the following feature of your <code>money.DebtCalculator</code> class:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The <code>findCycle</code> method that takes no parameters and returns a reference to a
                <code>Cycle</code> object using
                the provided <code>Cycle</code> class. This method will detect if there is a cycle in the debt data and
                will return it if it exists. A cycle exists if there's any number of people all of whom owe
                money to the next person in a way the eventually returns to the original debtor. The amount of
                the cycle is the minimum amount owed throughout the cycle. If such a cycle exists, the amount of
                each debt in the cycle could be reduced by the cycle amount (You don't have to reduce the debts,
                just detect the cycle). For example, if Paul owes Jesse $50, Jesse owes Leo $75, and Leo owes
                Paul $100, there is a cycle [Paul, Jesse, Leo] of $50
            </li>
            <li>
                If no cycle exists, the method returns <code>null</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                If a cycle exists, return a <code>Cycle</code> object containing the names of everyone in the cycle in
                the
                order in which they appear, and the cycle amount. Note that the starting point is ambiguous so
                your tests must accept any valid ordering. In the example above, there are three valid orderings
                [Paul, Jesse, Leo], [Jesse, Leo, Paul], and [Leo, Paul, Jesse]
            </li>
            <li>
                You may assume that there is at most 1 cycle in the file of data and your test cases should
                contain at most 1 cycle
            </li>
            <li>
                A cycle can be as small as 2 nodes (eg. 2 people owe each other money)
            </li>
        </ul>
