        <p>
            You will write a 4 function calculator without using any control flow, meaning you cannot write any
            code
            that will be executed conditionally. Instead, you will apply object-orientation programming
            approaches to
            make decisions based on <em>types</em> instead of <em>values</em>. Specifically, you are expected
            to use the state pattern to complete this assignment.

            You can run the <code>calculator.view.CalculatorGUI</code> class to see the provided GUI. Your goal is to add
            functionality to this GUI by implementing the <code>calculator.model.Calculator</code> class.
            Do not edit any code in the <code>view</code> or <code>controller</code> packages.
            You have full control over the <code>model</code> package and this is where you will write all of your code. You
            may add any methods, variables, objects, classes, interfaces, or sub-packages youâ€™d like to complete the
            objectives.
            All testing, including your tests, will only access the <code>calculator.model.Calculator</code> class and will
            only call methods provided in the <code>Calculator</code> class. You may add more methods/variables/classes/etc,
            but do
            not access them from your tests since they will not exist in my solutions on Autolab.

            First Application Objective - Basic Features
        </h3>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            Test and implement basic functionality for your calculator to earn the first application objective
        </p>

        <h5>
            Testing Requirements
        </h5>

        <p>
            Test the following features of your <code>calculator.model.Calculator</code> class. In your tests, only call the
            methods that are provided in the handout code as any other methods.variables.classes won't exist
            in the solutions and will cause errors in Autolab. You will call the various
            "pressed" methods to simulate pressing buttons on the calculator, then call <code>displayNumber</code> and
            assert that it returns the expected value.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this application objective, test the following functionality in the <code>tests.TestCalculator</code> class:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The calculator initially displays 0.0
            </li>
            <li>
                Pressing the number buttons will append that number to the end of the displayed number. For this
                objective, you may assume all the numbers entered will be whole numbers (ie. the decimal button
                will never be pressed when testing for the first application objective). For example, starting
                the calculator and pressing [4, 6, then 1] should result in <code>displayNumber()</code> returning 461.0.
                When testing the number buttons, only call the <code>numberPressed</code> method with an input in the
                range 0-9. These are the only inputs that the GUI can call the method with and all others
                should be considered invalid and should not be tested
            </li>
            <li>
                Test the 4 operator buttons (+, -, *, /). The user can enter a number (With any number of
                digits), press an operator button,
                enter another number (With any number of digits), then press equals and the displayed
                number should be the result of the
                operation. Ex. If the user presses [2, 5, /, 5, =], <code>displayNumber()</code> should return 5.0
            </li>
            <li>
                After pressing =, another operation can be entered which will use the result of the previous
                operation as its left hand side value Ex. [2, 0, +, 1, 5, =, /, 1, 0, =] results in 3.5 being
                displayed. [3, +, 4, =, *, 2, =] results in 14.0 being displayed
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You'll need to append digits to the end of numbers and also display them as <code>Doubles</code>. It can help to
            store
            the numbers as both <code>Strings</code> and <code>doubles</code> to build this functionality. When a digit is pressed,
            concatenate
            the digit to the end of the <code>String</code>, then convert the <code>String</code> to a <code>double</code> and store this separately for the
            <code>displayNumber</code> method. (Or convert the <code>String</code> to a <code>double</code> in the <code>displayNumber</code> method)
        </p>

            Second Application Objective - Advance Features
        </h3>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            Test and implement advanced functionality for your calculator to earn the second application
            objective
        </p>

        <h5>
            Testing Requirements
        </h5>

        <p>
            For this application objective, test the following functionality in the <code>tests.TestCalculator</code> class:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The clear button returns the calculator to it's initial state with 0.0 being displayed
            </li>
            <li>
                Test the decimal button allowing for floating point inputs. The first time the decimal button
                is pressed when number is being entered will determine where the decimal point will be placed.
                All subsequent presses of the decimal button for that same number will have no effect.
                Ex. [1, 2, ., ., 5, ., ., 0, ., 5] should display 12.505
            </li>
            <li>
                Entering decimal as the first button when entering a number will have 0 as its whole number
                portion Ex. [., 5] results in 0.5 being displayed
            </li>
            <li>
                Pressing equals multiple times in a row will repeat the previous operation
                Ex. [8, 0, -, 1, 0, =, =, =, =] results in 40.0 being displayed
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>
            Undefined behaviour
        </h5>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            To limit the complexity of this assignment there are certain sequences of button presses that have
            undefined behaviour. These sequences will not be tested in Autolab and you must not test these
            sequences
            in your tests since the expected number to be displayed is undefined. Do not test any of the
            following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only pressing the decimal button when entering a number Ex. [., +, 1, =], [6, *, ., =]</li>
            <li>Pressing consecutive operator buttons Ex. [2, 5, /, *, 5, =]</li>
            <li>Pressing an operator or equals before entering a number Ex. [+, 1, 1, 6, =] or [5, 5, +, =]</li>
            <li>Pressing another operator button before pressing = Ex. [2, 5, /, 5, +, 7, =]</li>
            <li>Pressing a number button after equals Ex [2, +, 2, =, 4]</li>
            <li>The value that's displayed after an operator button is pressed, but before = is pressed.
                Ex. The only time you should test the returned value of <code>displayNumber</code> is when the first
                number is being entered or immediately after the = button is pressed
            </li>
        </ul>
