            Project Structure
        </h3>

        <hr/>
        <p>
            You will continue to add functionality to your existing project from the previous task. There is
            no new repository to clone.

        <h3>
            Using the Graphics Engine - Sprites
        </h3>

        <hr/>

        <p>
            Rather than completing functionality of the game engine as was the focus of the previous tasks,
            this task will mainly be focused on building new features. In order to do so, we'll need to tell the
            game engine what sprites to load for the new objects. While you don't need to understand how the game
            engine does this, we will briefly explain how to assign new sprites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everything in game that can have a sprite (e.g. GameObjects, DynamicGameObjects) has instance variables
            called
            <code>spriteSheetFilename</code> and <code>defaultSpriteLocation</code>. In most
            2D games, rather than storing each individual sprite as its own file, we store groups of sprites together in
            a single file called a spritesheet, then tell the engine which sprite on the sheet to load.
            <code>spriteSheetFilename</code> is a String that represents the filename containing the spritesheet
            with the desired sprite in it. <code>defaultSpriteLocation</code> takes in a <code>SpriteLocation</code>
            object.
            For the sake of this task, all you need to know about the <code>SpriteLocation</code> class is that it has
            a constructor taking in the row and column of the desired sprite in the spritesheet (feel free to look
            through
            the data directory to understand what these files look like).
        </p>

        <p>So, to add a sprite to an object, we just need to set values to these instance variables in the
            constructor. For example, this is how the Wall class sets the sprites:</p>

        <p>
            <code>this.spriteSheetFilename = "Ground/Cliff.png";
                <br/>
                this.defaultSpriteLocation = new SpriteLocation(3, 0);</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Any time anything you add needs a sprite, the handout will specify what the filename and location
            should be to load a good sprite for the object. We will not test which sprites you use, so if you wish you
            may use different sprites. All of the suggested sprites already exist in the project, but the sprite sheet
            linked below has some additional sprites that you may wish to use; if you choose to, you should save this
            image into the data directory of your project, by right clicking and pressing "Save Image as..."
        </p>

        <h5><a href="/static_files/images/Textures-16.png">Task 3 Textures</a></h5>

        <p>
            You may also want to visit the link in the "data/sprites.txt" file to find the source of all sprites used in
            this project and download any sprites that interest you.
        </p>

        <h3>Specification</h3>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            In this task, you will implement the following specs. Once all of these are complete, you will have created
            a platformer game using the same game engine we built for the top-down game. In this new game, your
            character will be able to jump around a level with a side-view while avoiding spikes.
        </p>

        <p>
            While implementing the functionality in this task, you will use much of the existing inheritance structure
            of the project. You should take some time to look through the code and explore all the inheritance usage
            to give more context for the new classes/methods you'll create.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>Potion</code> (<code>app.games.commonobjects.Potion)</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the <code>commonobjects</code> package, create a new class called Potion that
                        extends DynamicGameObject.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a constructor that takes in two parameters: a Vector2D representing location
                        and an int representing the amount to heal, which should be stored as an instance variable
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you call the super constructor, give the Potion a max HP of 10.</li>
                            <li>
                                Graphics (See "Using the Graphics Engine" for more detail):
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You should initialize <code>spriteSheetFilename</code> to "User
                                        Interface/Icons-Essentials.png"
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If the amount to heal is non-negative (This includes 0), the <code>defaultSpriteLocation</code>
                                        should be a
                                        SpriteLocation at column 0, row 1
                                        (see the "Using the Graphics Engine" section of the handout)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If the amount to heal is negative, the <code>defaultSpriteLocation</code> should
                                        be a SpriteLocation at column 1, row 1.
                                        This turns the potion into a poison
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Note: Both <code>spriteSheetFilename</code> and
                                        <code>defaultSpriteLocation</code>
                                        are protected variables meaning you can access them using <code>this.</code>
                                        even though they are not defined in this class
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        Override the <code>collideWithDynamicObject</code> method. If the object being collided with
                        is a Player, you should add the amount to heal (from the constructor) to the Player's HP, then
                        call
                        <code>this.destroy()</code> to remove the Potion from the level. If the other object is not a
                        Player, this method does nothing
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can check if a DynamicGameObject is a player by calling the <code>isPlayer</code>
                                method on it.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Optional: To see your Potion in game, you can choose one of the methods creating a level
                        (levelZero, levelOne, levelTwo) in the
                        <code>SampleTopDownGame</code> class and add a new Potion object to the Level's
                        DynamicGameObject ArrayList
                        (follow the process the given code uses to add an Enemy to the level, but with a Potion
                        constructor instead.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The remainder of this task will be implementing a new physics engine. While the physics engine you wrote in
            task 1 was designed for top-down levels where you freely move around a 2D space, this new physics engine
            will be designed for 2D platformer levels where your movement is constrained to moving left, right, and
            jumping.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>DynamicGameObject</code> - Platformer Preparation (<code>app.gameengine.model.gameobjects.DynamicGameObject</code>)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add an instance variable of type boolean representing if the given DynamicGameObject is on the
                        ground.
                        This should be initialized to <code>false</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a method called <code>isOnGround</code> that takes no parameters and returns a boolean. Add
                        a
                        method called <code>setOnGround</code> that takes in a boolean and returns void. These should be
                        the getter and setter for the previously described instance variable
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>PhysicsEngineWithGravity</code>
                (<code>app.gameengine.model.physics.PhysicsEngineWithGravity</code>)
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a new class called PhysicsEngineWithGravity in the app.gameengine.model.physics package
                        that extends PhysicsEngine. We'll see the power of inheritance where we will only have to add
                        gravity while reusing all of your code from PhysicsEngine to still handle collisions and
                        movement. This will allow us to make games that have gravity applied to dynamic objects
                    </li>
                    <li>Write a constructor that takes in a single double representing the acceleration from gravity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Override the updateObject method to have the following behavior:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add the change in velocity from gravity to the DynamicGameObject's
                                y-velocity (note that change in velocity is equal to acceleration from gravity times the
                                change in time). This will decrease the objects y-velocity on every frame. Since the
                                game runs at 60 fps, this linear change every frame will appear as a parabola when
                                playing the game
                            </li>
                            <li>Call the super class' updateObject method and pass in the parameters. Be sure to call
                                this after applying gravity or the movement will be a little jenky
                            </li>
                            <li>Keep in mind that the positive y direction is downward in the world of computers. The
                                acceleration from gravity is directionless (only magnitude) so it will always be
                                positive (Yes this annoys physicists, but Earths gravity would be positive 9.81 [with no
                                units] in our game)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And that's it. By leveraging inheritance, you should have just created gravity with about 20
                        lines of code (including package and imports). You have the power of a god!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>PlatformerWall</code> (<code>app.games.platformerobjects.PlatformerWall</code>)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Create the <code>app.games.platformerobjects</code> package and add a class named
                        <code>PlatformerWall</code> in it
                        that extends <code>Wall</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write a constructor that takes in two ints representing the x and y location of the
                        <code>PlatformerWall</code>. These should be passed into the super constructor.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The suggested spriteSheetFilename for this class is "Ground/Cliff.png", and the
                                suggested
                                defaultSpriteLocation is column 4, row 0.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Override the <code>collideWithDynamicObject</code> method to have the following behavior:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firstly, resolve the collision exactly as the base Wall class does. You can do this by
                                calling <code>super.collideWithDynamicObject</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Since we have to consider the cases where the object lands on top or bumps on the
                                bottom,
                                add the following logic after resolving the collision:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        If the DynamicGameObject is overlapping in the x-dimension with the Wall, set
                                        the y-velocity to 0.0. This makes it so the object stops falling when it lands on
                                        top
                                        of the wall or start falling if it hits the bottom.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                When determining if the overlap is occurring, you should not include the
                                                edges (if the
                                                object's left == the wall's right or the object's right == the wall's
                                                left, it's not
                                                overlapping)
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Additionally, if that condition occurs and the object is above the wall (the
                                        case
                                        where it lands on top), you should also mark that the object is on the ground
                                        using
                                        the previously written setter.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Note that we are using what we know about the objects in this method. Since the
                                        method was called, we know that these objects collided. Since we called the
                                        Wall's collideWithDynamicObject method (That you wrote in task 1), we know that
                                        they are no longer colliding. After this, if they still overlap in the x
                                        direction we know that the Wall's method moved the dynamic object either up or
                                        down (It resolved the collision by removing the y overlap). This means we either
                                        landed on the top of the wall, or hit our head on the ceiling. In either case,
                                        our y velocity should be set to 0. When landing, we want to report to the object
                                        that it is now standing on ground which we will use later to know that we're
                                        allowed to jump

            <li>
                <code>Spike</code> (<code>app.games.platformerobjects.Spike</code>)
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a class called Spike that extends StaticGameObject</li>
                    <li>
                        Write a constructor that takes in two ints representing the x and y location of the
                        Spike. These should be passed into the super constructor
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The suggested spriteSheetFilename for this class is "User Interface/UiIcons.png", and
                                the suggested
                                defaultSpriteLocation is column 2, row 10
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Override the <code>collideWithDynamicObject</code> method to have the following behavior:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the colliding object is a Player, call the <code>destroy</code> method on it.
                                Otherwise, do nothing
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This class does not change any velocity or location of the other object. Since it's being
                        destroyed, we don't care about how it's moving
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>PlatformerLevel</code> (<code>app.games.platformerobjects.PlatformerLevel</code>)
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a class called PlatformerLevel that extends Level.</li>
                    <li>
                        Override the wallOffBoundary method. This should have the exact same behavior as wallOffBoundary
                        in <code>app.gameengine.Level</code>, but with PlatformerWalls rather than Walls.
                    </li>


                    <li>Create a constructor that takes in a Game, an int for width, an int for height, and a String
                        for name in this order. This constructor should:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Call the super constructor with the Game, a PhysicsEngineWithGravity object, the width,
                                the height, and the name in this order.
                                When creating the PhysicsEngineWithGravity object, use a gravity of 25.0
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Assign the inherited instance variable <code>gameControls</code> with a new
                                PlatformerMovement object.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The PlatformerMovement is already written in the handout. You should pass in the
                                        game as the first parameter and
                                        the default movement speed as the second parameter
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The default movement speed should be 5.0
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Call the WallOffBoundary method.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Override the inherited <code>jumpButtonPressed</code> method
                        from the Level class. This will be called whenever your character jumps (press up or w) in a
                        PlatformerLevel
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This method should check if the player is on the ground. If so, it should set the
                                player's
                                y velocity to -14.0, and set the onGround flag to false. If the player is not on the
                                ground, it
                                should do nothing
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Finally, you will create a new Game subclass that will be used to play Levels using these new features.
            You're welcome to create your own Levels, but we will also be providing Levels via the course
            Piazza.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>Game</code> (<code>app.gameengine.Game</code>)
                <ul>
                    <li>Move the Level functionality added in the previous task in SampleTopDownGame to the base game
                        class
                    </li>
                    <li>This will include the instance variable, addLevel, getLevelList, setLevelList, advanceLevel, and
                        removeLevelByName (And remove the existing advanceLevel stubbed method). Make your instance
                        variable protected if you use in the init method in SampleTopDownGame. Remove the init() call
                        from the SampleTopDownGame constructor since it will be called by the super constructor
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a method that returns void and takes no parameters called <code>init</code>. This method
                        should do nothing and only exists to be inherited and overridden
                    </li>
                    <li>Modify the Game constructor to call the <code>init</code> method</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li><code>PlatformerGame</code> (<code>app.games.PlatformerGame</code>)
                <ul>
                    <li>Make a new class called PlatformerGame that extends the Game class.</li>
                    <li>
                        Override the init method to add levels to the game and load your first level. This can be done
                        using the inherited addLevel method
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You have the freedom to add whatever levels you'd like to this game. The actual
                                content of the Level list will not be considered except that it exists
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Note that if you don't write any constructor, you will still get the correct behavior since we
                        only need the default constructor (no params, empty body). We could also remove the
                        SampleTopDownGame constructor and still play it normally
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To actually play your game, update the switch statement in <code>GameFactory</code> (in the
            <code>app.games</code> package) to have a case for "platformer game". In this case, it should assign game
            to a new PlatformerGame object, then break. You can then replace the game String in
            <code>Configuration</code>
            in the <code>app</code> package with "platformer game". After that, running StartGame will load up your new
            game.
        </p>

            Note: You can see feedback in Autolab for your tests without completing the
            programming portion of
            this task, but you must at least create every class/method from this specification. You can "stub
            out"
            these methods by having them always return a fixed value, but they must exist so the grading code,
            and your tests, can compile and run.

        <p>You will write tests for the following functionality from the specification:</p>

                        is being updated correctly (as you know the base Wall class is already functional). You
                        only need to test that the velocity and isOnGround is getting set correctly.

        <h3>Autolab Feedback</h3>
        <hr/>

        <p>
            The feedback in Autolab will be given in 3 phases. If you don't complete a phase, then feedback for
            the following phase(s) will not be provided.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Running your tests on a correct solution
                <ul>
                    <li>Your tests will be run against a solution that is known to be correct. If your tests do
                        not pass this correct solution, there is an error somewhere in your tests that must be
                        fixed
                        before you can move on with the assignment. If your tests don't get past this check, you
                        should re-read this document and make sure you implemented your tests and code according
                        the specification. You should also make sure that if there are multiple correct outputs
                        to the input in your tests cases that you accept any of the outputs as correct
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Checking your tests for feature coverage
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The next phase is to check if your tests check for a variety of features defined by
                        different inputs. You should write at least one test case for each feature to pass this
                        phase
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Passing this phase does not necessarily mean that your testing is completely thorough.
                        Satisfying Autolab is the bare minimum testing requirement. Not all possible inputs are
                        checked, and it is sometimes possible to pass this phase
                        with weak testing. If you are struggling to earn credit for code that you believe
                        is correct, you should write more than the required tests
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Running my tests on your solution
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Once Autolab is happy with your tests, it will run my tests against your code to check
                        it for correctness. If your testing is thorough, and your code passes your tests, then
                        you should pass this phase. If you pass your tests, but fail one of mine, it is an
                        indicator that you should write more tests to help expose your bug
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Once you complete all 3 phases, you will have completed this Task and Autolab will confirm this
            with a score of 1.0 for complete.
