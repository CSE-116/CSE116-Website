        <p class="card-text">
            In CSE115 you've learned the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow,
            data structures, file IO, networking, databases, and security. With these concepts you can train a computer
            to complete any task you can imagine. So what's left to study in CSE116?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>How to write large programs</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            While you can apply what you already know to code practically anything a computer is capable of processing,
            it becomes very difficult very fast to write and organize
            large and complex pieces of software. To this end, in CSE116 you will study:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Program Execution</b></li>
            <li><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b></li>
            <li><b>Functional Programming</b></li>
            <li><b>Data Structures & Algorithms</b></li>
            <li><b>Event-Based Architectures</b>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While studying these topics we will have a strong focus on <em>how</em> your programs work, not just
            <em>that</em> they work.

        <h3 class="card-title">Expectations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            This is not an easy course! To do well in this course you are expected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invest a minimum of <b>12 hours/week</b> in CSE116 including at least 7 hours/week outside of class/lab
            </li>
            <li>Want to learn about computer science (This is assumed since you are taking a second CSE course)</li>
            <li>Be comfortable with <b>all</b> of the CSE115 material</li>
            <li>Participate in every lecture and lab (Except the first week when there are no labs)</li>
            <li>Bring a working and charged laptop to lab (If this is not possible for you, communicate with Jesse and/or your TAs to find a solution that works for you)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The 12 hour/week minimum assumes that you are up-to-date on all concepts that have been covered. If you
            are not comfortable with all the CSE115 material you should expect to work significantly more than
            12 hours/week until you are caught up with the material. Likewise, if you invest less than 12 hours/week in
            CSE116 during the first several weeks of the semester you should expect to work significantly more than
            12 hours/week later in the semester (ie. Expect to spend 40+ hours in a single week if you wait until a
            major deadline before studying).
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are unable or unwilling to spend at least 12 hours/week on this course, please navigate your
            browser to the hub and drop CSE116. Dropping is much better for your transcript than an F or an R.

        <h3 class="card-title">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p>
            I CSE116 you will learn concepts related to the following 5 learning objectives. Being successful in CSE116
            requires completing all 5 of these objectives.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Program Execution</h4>

        <p>
            How does a program run? In CSE115 there was a focus on writing programs to accomplish specific tasks. Now
            we want to focus on how those programs run. We will look at how a program's memory is managed as well as
            how to automate the testing of program to ensure that it behaves the way it should.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective">Write and run automated tests to verify the functionality of a method</li>
            <li class="objective">Implement, and trace through the execution of, programs that pass references of objects to methods</li>
            <li class="objective">Trace through a program and track the state of the stack and heap memory throughout
                its execution
            </li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Object-Oriented Programming</h4>

        <p>
            Instead of writing programs as a collection of variables and functions, object-oriented programming groups
            these variables and functions into classes and objects. This allows developers to reason about their
            programs at a higher level of abstraction and simplifies code reuse.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective">Use inheritance to create a new class by extending an existing class and overriding
                its functionality
            </li>
            <li class="objective">Implement, and trace through the execution of, programs that use polymorphism</li>
            <li class="objective">Implement programs that change behavior based on the type of an object stored in a
                variable
            </li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Functional Programming</h4>

        <p>
            Functional programming is based on functions with clearly defined input/output behavior. If a function is
            called multiple times with the same input it must always have the same output regardless of the state of
            the program. This consistent behavior make functional programs suitable for multi-threading and
            distributed systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective">Implement, and trace the execution of, recursive methods or functions</li>
            <li class="objective">Implement, call, and trace the execution of methods that take a function as a parameter and return a function</li>
            <li class="objective">Implement, and trace through the execution of, programs that have no side-effects (immutability)</li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>

        <p>
            We will study several new approaches for storing data and computing with that data. Primarily we will see
            linked-lists, trees, and graphs while exploring applications of each structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective">Implement programs that use linked-lists, trees, and graphs and their algorithms</li>
            <li class="objective">Implement new algorithms to expand the functionality of linked-lists, trees, and
                graphs
            </li>
            <li class="objective">Trace through the execution of programs using linked-lists, trees, and graphs</li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Event-Based Architectures</h4>

        <p>
            As CPUs and GPUs add more cores and large apps are distributed across multiple machines (ex. YouTube is
            much too large run on a single machine) the importance of concurrency executing code is more important than
            ever. Event-based architectures provide a way for concurrent running pieces of code to communicate with
            each other while accomplishing the goals of a larger program.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective">Implement event-based software using actor systems</li>
            <li class="objective">Implement event-based software using web sockets</li>
            <li class="objective">Trace through the execution of software designed with event-based architectures</li>
        </ul>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Learning Objective Completion</h4>

        <p>
            <b>
                You must demonstrate that you've completed all 5 learning objectives in order to pass this class.
            </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            All decisions relating to learning objective completion will be made by Jesse using your performance in
            the course as evidence. At a minimum, for each of the 5 learning objectives you will have the following
            opportunities to demonstrate completion of the objective:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Six lecture questions</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each learning objective will be covered across six lectures. Each lecture will have a
                    corresponding lecture question to be submitted on AutoLab. These questions have a deadline of
                    midnight the day after lecture.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>One lab activity</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each learning objective has a corresponding lab session that will include a lab activity. These
                    activities are to be completed during the 110 minute lab period.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>One interview with a TA</li>
            <ul>
                <li>During the lab activity your TA will visit each student for a short interview. The TA may ask any
                    questions they deem appropriate in order to assess your completion of the learning objective.
                    Following the interview, the TA will submit a report to Jesse based on your performance.
                </li><li>
                Your
                    TA does not make decisions for learning objective completion. Jesse will weight all evidence
                    while reviewing these reports and efforts will be made to neutralize the variance between TAs (ie.
                    Your completion of learning objectives should not be affected by which TA you were assigned).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>The final exam</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Any student failing to complete a learning objective via the lecture questions and lab will have
                    one last opportunity to prove completion during the final exam time.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Decisions for completion of a learning objective will be made using your performance
            throughout these opportunities as evidence. Note that there is no simple correlation between completion
            of these opportunities and completion of the learning objective. Completion of a lecture question or lab
            activity will be only one aspect considered in determining if you truly completed the learning objective.
        </p>


        <ul>
            <li>
                Example: Getting credit on AutoLab with code that you cannot explain, or that bypasses the learning
                objective (eg. Not using recursion on a recursion lecture question), does not demonstrate completion
                of the learning objective.
            </li>
            <li>
                Example: Not getting credit on AutoLab for a reason that has nothing to do with the learning objective
                (eg. A capital letter that should be lowercase) does not diminish completion of the learning
                objective.
            </li>
        </ul>



        <hr/>
        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            You can improve your letter grade by proving that you can <b>apply</b> the learning objectives to solve
            <b>real-world problems</b>. You will have 8 opportunities to complete application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Homework Assignments x5</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 5 learning objectives will have one or more corresponding homework assignments. Complete
                    one homework assignment for a learning objective and verify completion with your TA to complete these
                    objectives. Homework verification will take place in certain lab sessions. Completing more than 1
                    homework assignment for a single learning objective will not result in additional credit.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Homework Expansion</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some homework assignments will contain expansion opportunities. These will be open-ended objectives
                    that expand the functionality of the software. Complete one of these expansions and demonstrate your
                    software to your TA during a homework verification lab.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Project Contribution</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The last section of the course will involve a large project. Your contribution to the project is
                    another opportunity to complete an application objective. Contributions will be demonstrated during
                    lab.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Open-Ended Software</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Show us something cool: Apply the skills your acquired throughout this course to build software
                of interest to you. The software must be approved by the course staff and must use the skills of this
                    course (ie. A student coming out of CSE115 should not be able to develop your software without
                    self-studying CSE116 topics)</li>
                <li>Alternative: You may complete a second homework expansion to earn credit for this opportunity</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            All application objectives must be verified by the course staff to earn credit for completion. During
            homework verification labs you must be prepared to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Communicate effectively at a technical level regarding the assignment</li>
            <li>Describe the expected behavior of the homework software</li>
            <li>Demonstrate your solution by running your software and using it for its intended purpose</li>
            <li>Explain the code and design decisions in your homework submission</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            As with the learning objectives:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>It is possible to pass all the tests on AutoLab and not complete the application objective if you fail
                any of the above verification tasks.</li>
            <li>
                It is possible to fail some/all tests on AutoLab and still complete the application objective depending
                on the specific situation. (Final decisions will be made by Jesse based on recommendations from TAs)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The amount and type of verification required will depend on your AutoLab results when applicable.

            In addition to the department and university policies, the following details apply to this course.
        </p>

        <p>

            All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All violations will result in:

            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.
