        <p class="card-text">
            You know the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow,
            data structures, and file IO. With these concepts, you can train a computer
            to complete nearly any task you can imagine. So what's next?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Writing large programs</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            You will learn how to write and organize large pieces of software. To this end, in CSE116 you will study:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Unit Testing</b></li>
            <li><b>Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b></li>
            <li><b>Data Structures & Algorithms</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While studying these topics we will have a focus on <em>how</em> your programs work, not just
            <em>that</em> they work.

        <h3 class="card-title">Expectations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            This is not an easy course! To do well in this course you are expected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invest a minimum of <b>12 hours/week*</b> in CSE116 including at least 7 hours/week outside of class/lab</li>
            <li>Want to learn about computer science (This is assumed since you are taking a second CSE course)</li>
            <li>Understand the basics of programming</li>
            <li>Participate in every lecture and lab (There will NOT be a lab during week 1)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            * The 12 hour/week minimum is an average. If you invest less than 12 hours/week in
            CSE116 during the first several weeks of the semester, or do not fully understand all the CSE115 topics,
            you should expect to work significantly more than
            12 hours/week while you catch up. You should expect to spend 40+ hours in a single week on this course
            alone if you fall behind or if you're not comfortable with the CSE115 material.

        <h3 class="card-title">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p>
            Being successful in CSE116 requires completion of all of the learning objective requirements.
            You must complete <b>every</b> Learning Objective requirement in order to pass CSE116.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning objectives are divided into 2 primary categories:
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Classes/Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h4>

        <p>
            Instead of writing programs as a collection of variables and functions, with object-oriented programming
            we will group
            these variables and functions into classes and objects. This allows developers to reason about their
            programs at a higher level of abstraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read/Quiz</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism while tracking the state of stack and heap memory using
                memory diagrams</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Explain/Interview</b>: Describe the concepts of classes, inheritance, and
                polymorphism and explain how they can be used to help us write software</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write programs and testing that use classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism
            </li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>

        <p>
            We will study several new approaches for storing data and computing with that data. Primarily, we will see
            linked-lists, trees, and graphs while exploring applications of each data structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read/Quiz</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use linked-lists and trees
                 using memory diagrams</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Explain/Interview</b>: Describe the structure and applications of linked-lists and trees
            </li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write programs and testing that use linked-lists, trees, and graphs as well as
                implement new algorithms to expand the functionality of each data structure</li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Learning Objective Completion</h4>

        <p>
            <b>
                To complete the learning objectives of this course, you must complete all of the following requirements.
            </b>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Read - Lab Quiz x3</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are 3 lab quiz requirements that must be completed throughout the semester. These
                    quizzes are labeled on the course schedule as:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Quiz 1 - Java Basics and Classes</li>
                    <li>Quiz 2 - Linked-Lists and Trees</li>
                    <li>Quiz 3 - Inheritance and Polymorphism</li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Quizzes will be completed during your lab section and will assess you ability to trace through
                    stack and heap memory during the execution of given code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These quizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis. If you pass the quiz, you have completed the
                    learning objective portion of that quiz. All completion decisions will be made by a human
                    after reviewing your submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are 2 lab quizzes on the schedule for each quiz labelled as "first chance" and
                    "second chance". If you do not complete the quiz on the first chance, you can attempt the quiz again
                    during the second chance quiz. If the course staff verifies
                    that you've completed the learning objective on the first quiz, you do
                    not have to take the quiz during the second chance lab.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you do not complete all three quizzes after your first 2 attempts, you will be given a 3rd chance to complete each quiz during the final exam
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Explain - Lab Interview x3</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There will be 3 lab interview requirements that must be completed throughout the semester. These
                    interviews are labeled on the course schedule as:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Interview 1 - Java Basics and Classes</li>
                    <li>Interview 2 - Linked-Lists and Trees</li>
                    <li>Interview 3 - Inheritance and Polymorphism</li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    During interview labs, you
                    will have a 10-minute interview with a TA. The TA may ask any
                    questions they deem appropriate in order to assess that you can explain the relevant concept.
                    The TA will submit a summary of your answers that will be reviewed by the course staff.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As with the lab quizzes, the interviews are graded on a pass/fail basis. After human review of your
                    answers, it will be
                    decided whether or not you completed the explain portion of the learning objective through your
                    interview performance. If you complete the interview during the first chance lab,
                    you do not have to interview again during the second chance lab.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your interviewing TA does not make decisions for learning objective completion. Do not pressure your TA into
                    marking you for completion. Likewise, your TA cannot tell you during the interview whether or not you
                    passed since they will not know. The course staff will weigh all evidence
                    while reviewing the reports from all TAs and efforts will be made to neutralize the variance between
                    TAs (i.e.
                    Your completion of learning objectives should not be affected by which TA you were assigned for an
                    interview).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you do not complete all three interview after your first 2 attempts, you will be given a 3rd
                    chance to complete each interview during the final exam. The final exam interviews will be
                    interview-style questions, but it will be a written exam where you'll write your answers to the questions
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Write - Programming Tasks x8</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are 8 learning objective programming tasks assigned throughout the semester. To complete the write portion
                    of the learning objectives, you must complete all 8 tasks.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Final Exam: </b>The final exam is used as a 3rd chance to complete the quizzes and interviews. If you
            already completed all 3 quizzes and 3 interviews after the first 2 attempts for each, you do not need to
            attend the final exam.
        </p>

        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            Falling even 1 week behind in this course will significantly increase your chances of failing. Application
            Objectives offer you incentives to stay up-to-date on the material by giving you chances to improve your
            grade.

            <li>Programming Task Expected Deadlines x16</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 8 programming tasks have 3 separate deadlines. Completing all tasks before the earliest
                    deadline will earn you a total of 16 application objectives. These deadlines are:
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Expected Deadline: </b>The expected deadline is set on the Friday morning after the week when the
                    material for the task was covered in lecture. As the name implies, this is when you are expected to
                    be able to complete the task if you are keeping up with the course. Each time you complete a task
                    before it's expected deadline, you will earn 2 application objectives

                <li>
                    <b>Late Deadline: </b>This deadline is set to the Wednesday morning following the expected deadline.
                    Complete a task before this deadline to ear 1 application objective. This allows you a second
                    chance to still earn an application objective even if you miss the expected deadline

                    learning objectives and therefore does not need to be completed to pass the class. This task offers
                    the opportunity to earn 2 additional application objectives
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Quizzes x6</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are 3 quizzes that you must complete in order to pass the class with 3 opportunities to
                    complete each one. These quizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis and you can earn application
                    objectives based on how many attempts you needed to use in order to pass each quiz
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete a quiz during the first chance lab, you'll earn 2 application objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete a quiz during the second chance lab [and did not complete it on the first chance],
                    you'll earn 1 application objective
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you need to take a quiz a 3rd time during the final exam, you cannot earn any application
                    objectives for that quiz
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Interview x6</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The interviews follow the same structure as the quizzes:
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete an interview during the first chance lab, you'll earn 2 application objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete an interview during the second chance lab [and did not complete it on the first chance],
                    you'll earn 1 application objective
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you need to take an interview a 3rd time during the final exam, you cannot earn any application
                    objectives for that interview
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Lecture Questions x4</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most lectures will include multiple choice questions to be answered during live lectures. These
                    will be simple
                    questions designed to encourage you to attend lecture and stay up to date on the material. Since
                    lectures will be recorded, there is a temptation to watch lecture days, or even weeks, after they
                    occur. These questions are to serve as an incentive for you to attend lecture and avoid falling
                    behind in the course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=80% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 4 application
                    objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=70% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 3 application
                    objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=60% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 2 application
                    objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=50% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 1 application
                    objectives.

            In addition to the department and university policies, the following details apply to this course.
        </p>

        <p>
            All submitted work must be of your own creation, and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All violations will result in:
        </p>

        <p>
            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of acceptable behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discussing an assignment with your classmates and brainstorming <b>abstract</b> solutions, then writing
                the code independently
            </li>
            <li>Forming study groups and discussing course material and assignments on Discord, Zoom, etc.</li>
            <li>Searching the Internet for supplementary material on the course topics</li>

            <li>Submitting code, or other work, for course credit that is not your own.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with another student to write code for an assignment. <-- This is the most common type of violation. DO NOT write code together!</li>
            <li>Using Artificial Intelligence to help you write code</li>
            <li>Allowing another student to see your code or submission for an assignment.</li>
            <li>Allowing another student to access your work that will be submitted for course credit. (Examples: Do not
                post you code publicly, host your code in a public repository, or allow a classmate to access your
