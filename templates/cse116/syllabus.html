        <p class="card-text">
            You know the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow,
            data structures, and file IO. With these concepts, you can train a computer
            to complete nearly any task you can imagine. So what's next?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Writing large programs</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            You will learn how to write and organize large pieces of software. To this end, in CSE116 you will study:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Unit Testing</b></li>
            <li><b>Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b></li>
            <li><b>Data Structures & Algorithms</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While studying these topics we will have a focus on <em>how</em> your programs work, not just
            <em>that</em> they work.

        <h3 class="card-title">Expectations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            This is not an easy course! To do well in this course you are expected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invest a minimum of <b>12 hours/lecture*</b> in CSE116 including at least 9 hours/week outside of class</li>
            <li>Want to learn about computer science (This is assumed since you are taking a second CSE course)</li>
            <li>Understand the basics of programming</li>
{#            <li>Participate in every lecture and lab (There will NOT be a lab during week 1)</li>#}
            <li>Stay up-to-date with the course content (You are expected to fully understand the content of every
                lecture <b>before the next lecture begins</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            * The 12 hour minimum is an average. If you invest less than 12 hours/lecture in
            CSE116 early in the semester, or do not fully understand all the CSE115 topics,
            you should expect to work significantly more than
            12 hours/lecture while you catch up. You should expect to spend 50+ hours in a single week on this course
            alone if you fall behind or if you're not comfortable with the CSE115 material. Do not fall behind.

        <h3 class="card-title">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p>
            Being successful in CSE116 requires completion of all of the learning objective requirements.
            You must complete <b>every</b> Learning Objective requirement in order to pass CSE116.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning objectives are divided into 2 primary categories:
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Classes/Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h4>

        <p>
            Instead of writing programs as a collection of variables and functions, with object-oriented programming
            we will group
            these variables and functions into classes and objects. This allows developers to reason about their
            programs at a higher level of abstraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read/Quiz</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism while tracking the state of stack and heap memory using
                memory diagrams</li>
{#            <li class="objective"><b>Explain/Interview</b>: Describe the concepts of classes, inheritance, and#}
{#                polymorphism and explain how they can be used to help us write software</li>#}
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write programs and testing that use classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism
            </li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>

        <p>
            We will study several new approaches for storing data and computing with that data. Primarily, we will see
            linked-lists, trees, and graphs while exploring applications of each data structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read/Quiz</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use linked-lists and trees
                 using memory diagrams</li>
{#            <li class="objective"><b>Explain/Interview</b>: Describe the structure and applications of linked-lists and trees#}
{#            </li>#}
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write programs and testing that use linked-lists, trees, and graphs as well as
                implement new algorithms to expand the functionality of each data structure</li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Learning Objective Completion</h4>

        <p>
            <b>
                To complete the learning objectives of this course, you must complete all of the following requirements.
            </b>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Quiz x2</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are 2 quiz requirements that must be completed during the semester.
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>OOP Quiz</li>
                    <li>Data Structures Quiz</li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Quizzes will be completed during midterm and/or final exam and will assess your ability to trace through
                    stack and heap memory during the execution of provided code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These quizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis. If you pass the quiz, you have completed the
                    learning objective portion of that quiz. All completion decisions will be made by a human
                    after reviewing your submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Both the midterm and final exam with consists of both the OOP and Data Structures quiz. This
                    provides you with 2 opportunities to complete each quiz. If you pass a quiz on the midterm, you
                    do not have to retake it on the final exam. If oyu pass both quizzes on the midterm, you do not
                    have to take the final exam.
                </li>
                <li>The midterm and final with both contain 2 programs to trace for each quiz. This means that for
                    each quiz (OOP and Dat Structures) you will have a total 4 opportunities to complete a trace for
                    that quiz. If you pass any of he 4 traces, you will have completed that learning objective (Meaning
                    that there are 8 total traces that you can complete. You must pass 1 OOP trace and 1 Data Structures
                    trace to pass the course.)</li>

            If you have completed all of the learning objectives, your grade will be determined by the number of
            application objectives you've completed. Most application objectives are designed to incentivize you to keep
            up with the material of the course and are not meant to be overly difficult to earn.

        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            Falling even 1 week behind in this course will significantly increase your chances of failing. Application
            Objectives offer you incentives to stay up-to-date on the material by giving you chances to improve your
            letter grade.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Programming Task Expected Deadlines x16</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 8 programming tasks have 3 separate deadlines. Completing all tasks before the earliest
                    deadline will earn you a total of 16 application objectives. These deadlines are:
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Expected Deadline: </b>The expected deadline is the morning (8am) 2 days after the
                    material for the task was covered in lecture (This is lass than 48 hours. The summer moves
                    extremely fast!). The intent is that you are expected to complete the task before the next lecture
                    begins. As the name implies, this is when you are expected to
                    be able to complete the task if you are keeping up with the course. Each time you complete a task
                    before it's expected deadline, you will earn 2 application objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Late Deadline: </b>The late deadline is the morning (8am) 5 days after the
                    material for the task was covered in lecture.
                    Complete a task before this deadline to earn 1 application objective. This allows you a second
                    chance to still earn an application objective even if you are failing behind in the course. If you
                    are consistently relying on the late deadlines, you are at risk of failing the course and must work
                    hard to catch back up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Final Deadline: </b>The final deadline is the night (11:59pm) 11 days after the
                    material for the task was covered in lecture. You must complete
                    all 8 tasks before their late deadlines, or you will fail the course. This means that if you miss any
                    of the 8 final deadlines, you will fail regardless of your performance throughout the
                    rest of the course. Students who fall behind enough to need to use a final deadline are often too
                    far behind to have any chance of catching back up. This deadline removes any false hope you may
                    have of catching up after falling so far behind. Meeting this deadline will not result in any
                    application objectives.

                    There are 4 total traces on the midterm exam. For each trace that you pass on the midterm, you will
                    earn 2 application objectives
                </li>
                <li>
                    The final exam gives you a second chance to pass the class via 4 more traces, but you will not earn
                    any application objectives if you needed to use the final exam

            All submitted work must be of your own creation, and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this course's academic integrity policy, and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.

            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.
