        <p class="card-text">
            In CSE115 you've learned the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow,
            data structures, file IO, networking, databases, and security. With these concepts you can train a computer
            to complete any task you can imagine. So what's left to study in CSE116?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>How to write large programs</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            While you can apply what you already know to code practically anything a computer is capable of processing,
            it becomes very difficult very fast to organize and write
            a large and complex piece of software. You will gain experience with this in CSE116 by studying topics
            such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Testing</b> to be confident that you program works without relying on AutoLab</li>
            <li><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> to organize and reuse code</li>
            <li><b>Concurrency</b> allowing multiple pieces of code to execute at the same time while
                communicating with each other
            </li>
            <li><b>First-Order Functions</b> which simplifies certain problems</li>
            <li>And finally, several <b>Data Structures</b> to organize and efficiently access data</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            While studying these topics we will have a strong focus on <em>how</em> your programs work, not just that
            they work.

        <h3 class="card-title">Expectations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            This is not an easy course! To do well in this course you are expected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Want to learn about computer science (This is assumed since you are taking a second CSE course)</li>
            <li>Already be comfortable with <b>all</b> of the CSE115 material</li>
            <li>Participate in every lecture and lab (Except the first week when there are no labs)</li>
            <li>Bring a working and charged laptop to lecture (If this is an issue please contact Jesse immediately and we'll work something out)</li>
            <li>Spend at least 7 hours each week outside of class/lab, on average, for a total of at least 12 hours/week on CSE116</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The 12 hour/week minimum assumes that you are up-to-date on all concepts that have been covered. If you
            are not comfortable with all the CSE115 material you should expect to work significantly more than
            12 hours/week until you are caught up with the material.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are unable or unwilling to spend at least 12 hours/week on this course, please navigate your
            browser to the hub and drop CSE116.

        <p class="card-text">

        <p>
            Your final grade will be determined using a points based system with the following max points per category:
        </p>

        <table class="table table-bordered table-skinny">
            <tr>
                <td>Homework and Homework Quizzes</td>

        <br/>

        <p>
            In accordance with the university grading policy, if you earn an F in this course while attending
            less than 60% of the meetings time (lecture and lab) you will instead earn a grade of FX.
        </p>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Homework and Homework Quizzes</h4>

        <p>
            There are 5 homework assignments throughout the semester worth 100 points each. These assignments will
            consume the majority of your >=7 hours/week outside of class/lab.
            To meet the objectives of this course these assignments will all require you to write fairly large programs
            with little guidance. In addition, you will not receive feedback on your submissions other than your score
            and compatibility issues (For example, the grader will let you know if you have the wrong filenames
            or directory structure). To encourage proper testing, you must test your own code and submit those tests
            in order to receive full credit on any homework assignment.
        </p>

        <p>
            There will be a homework quiz in lecture after each homework is due. These quizzes contain questions about
            the homework and potential solutions. Each quiz is worth 40 points.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Quizzes and Final Exam</h4>

        <p>
            There are 4 quizzes throughout the semester as well as a comprehensive final exam. These assessments will
            test your conceptual knowledge, as opposed to your coding ability. There are 2 grading options for the
            quizzes/exam:
        </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Quizzes worth 50 points each and the exam worth 200</li>
                <li>Quizzes worth 25 points each and the exam worth 300</li>
            </ol>

        <p>
            The option that maximizes your grade will automatically be applied. This allows you to make up some missed
            quiz points if you prepare well for the final exam.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Lab Activities</h4>

        <p>
            There will be 9 lab activities covering a variety of topics. Lab activities are worth 25 points each with
            your lowest score being dropped (Your best 8 scores count for your grade). If you have to miss a lab for any
            reason you will not be able to makeup that activity, but you can drop the 0 and complete the other 8 activities.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <table class="table table-bordered table-skinny">
            <tr>
                <td>Project Demos 4 x 100</td>
                <td>400</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lecture Questions</td>
                <td>300</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        100 bonus
        1 free quiz (across all 9) for when you miss a lecture



        <h4>Project Demos</h4>

        <p>
            You will have a semester-long team project submitted via 4 demos to your TA during lab. Each demo is worth
            100 points. You are expected to spend a
            significant amount of time outside of lab/lecture to complete the project.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Lecture Questions</h4>

        <p>
            Most lectures will consist of questions or activities that are to be completed before midnight on the day
            of the lecture. The total points for lecture questions will be capped at 300, though there will be more
            than 300 points available throughout the semester.
            This is meant to reduce the stress of missing a question or having to miss a lecture
            The intent of these questions is to give you
            an opportunity to
            practice the material as you are learning it as opposed to passively attending
            the lecture. To be fully prepared for these questions you should complete the reading for the lecture in
            advance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that these questions are not glorified attendance like you may have experienced in other courses.
            These will typically be programming questions related to the lecture topic of the day and submitted to
            AutoLab for grading.

        <h3 class="card-title">Communication</h3>

        <p>
            There are multiple communication channels available to you through this course. There is no requirement to
            use any of these, though you are encouraged to use any tools that you find helpful.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please note that these platforms are made available to help you communicate with your classmates as well
            as the course staff. The course
            staff will do what we can to be active on all platforms, but you should not expect us to answer every
            question and respond to every post. With that said, you are much more likely to get a response if you show
            that you are putting in the time to try to understand the material. Posts that just say "help, I'm confused"
            rarely get meaningful responses.

            These platforms are used to help you learn the course material with your classmates and the advantage
            of these is that the entire class can see the answers and conversation. Please do not use these to DM
            course staff with specific questions unless it's absolutely necessary. If you have a question that requires
            us to see
            your code you should visit us in office hours.
        </p>

        <p>
            If there is a question that requires my/Jesse's attention (ex. I have to sign paperwork, you have to
            reschedule the final exam, you require accessibility resources, etc) and you can't wait for my office hours
            please send an email to hartloff@buffalo.edu
            with the subject line "CSE116 Instructor" to ensure it gets my proper attention. Any emails/DMs/private
            posts that could be answered by any other means will largely be ignored. I would like to respond to all of
            you, but I simply do not have the time so I must prioritize this way.

        <p>

            All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>

            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.

            </li>
            <li>Copying a large amount material found on the Internet into your submission.</li>
