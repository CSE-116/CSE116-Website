        <p class="card-text">
            You know the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow,
            data structures, and file IO. With these concepts, you can train a computer
            to complete nearly any task you can imagine. So what's next?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Writing large programs</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            You will learn how to write and organize large pieces of software. To this end, in CSE116 you will study:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Unit Testing</b></li>
            <li><b>Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b></li>
            <li><b>Data Structures & Algorithms</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While studying these topics we will have a focus on <em>how</em> your programs work, not just
            <em>that</em> they work.

        <h3 class="card-title">Expectations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            This is not an easy course! To do well in this course you are expected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invest a minimum of <b>12 hours/week*</b> in CSE116 including at least 7 hours/week outside of class/lab</li>
            <li>Want to learn about computer science (This is assumed since you are taking a second CSE course)</li>
            <li>Be comfortable with <b>all</b> of the material from CSE115</li>
            <li>Participate in every lecture and lab (There will NOT be a lab during week 1)</li>
            <li>Have access to a computer with a reliable Internet connection</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            * The 12 hour/week minimum is an average. If you invest less than 12 hours/week in
            CSE116 during the first several weeks of the semester, or do not fully understand all the CSE115 topics,
            you should expect to work significantly more than
            12 hours/week while you catch up. You should expect to spend 40+ hours in a single week on this course
            alone if you fall behind or if you're not comfortable with the CSE115 material.

        <h3 class="card-title">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p>
            Being successful in CSE116 requires completion of all of the learning objective requirements.
            You must complete <b>every</b> Learning Objective requirement in order to pass CSE116.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning objectives are divided into 2 primary categories:
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Classes/Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h4>

        <p>
            Instead of writing programs as a collection of variables and functions, with object-oriented programming
            we will group
            these variables and functions into classes and objects. This allows developers to reason about their
            programs at a higher level of abstraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read/Quiz</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism while tracking the state of stack and heap memory using
                memory diagrams</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Explain/Interview</b>: Describe the concepts of classes, inheritance, and
                polymorphism and explain how they can be used to help us write software</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Test</b>: Write thorough unit tests to test code that uses classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write programs that use classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism
            </li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>

        <p>
            We will study several new approaches for storing data and computing with that data. Primarily, we will see
            linked-lists, trees, and graphs while exploring applications of each data structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read/Quiz</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use linked-lists, trees,
                and graphs using memory diagrams</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Explain/Interview</b>: Describe the structure of linked-lists, trees, and graphs and the
                implications of these structures including applications of each</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Test</b>: Write thorough unit tests to test code that uses linked-lists, trees,
                and graphs</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write programs that use linked-lists, trees, and graphs as well as
                implement new algorithms to expand the functionality of each data structure</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You must demonstrate that you've completed all learning objective requirements to earn a passing grade in this
            class. To complete a learning objective, you must complete all 4 portions (read, explain, test, write) of
            that category.
        </p>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Learning Objective Completion</h4>

        <p>
            <b>
                To complete the learning objectives of this course, you must complete all of the following requirements.
            </b>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Read - Lab Quiz x6</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There will be 6 lab quiz requirements that must be completed throughout the semester. These
                    quizzes are labeled on the course schedule as:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Classes 1 - Classes</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 1 - Linked-Lists</li>
                    <li>Classes 2 - Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 2 - Trees</li>
                    <li>Classes 3 - Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 3 - Graphs</li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Quizzes will be completed during your lab section and will assess you ability to trace through
                    stack and heap memory during the execution of given code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These quizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis. If you pass the quiz, you have completed the
                    learning objective portion of that quiz. All completion decisions will be made by a human
                    after reviewing your submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are 2 lab quizzes on the schedule for each quiz labelled as "first chance" and
                    "second chance". If you do not complete the quiz on the first chance, you can attempt the quiz again
                    during the second chance quiz. If the course staff verifies
                    that you've completed the learning objective on the first quiz, you do
                    not have to take the quiz during the second chance lab.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Explain - Lab Interview x6</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There will be 6 lab interview requirements that must be completed throughout the semester. These
                    interviews are labeled on the course schedule as:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Classes 1 - Classes</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 1 - Linked-Lists</li>
                    <li>Classes 2 - Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 2 - Trees</li>
                    <li>Classes 3 - Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 3 - Graphs</li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    While you are taking your lab quiz, you
                    will have a 10-minute interview with a TA. The TA may ask any
                    questions they deem appropriate in order to assess that you can explain the relevant concept.
                    The TA will submit a summary of your answers that will be reviewed by the course staff.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As with the lab quizzes, the interviews are graded on a pass/fail basis. After human review of your
                    answers, it will be
                    decided whether or not you completed the explain portion of the learning objective through your
                    interview performance. If you complete the interview during the first learning objective verification lab,
                    you do not have to interview again during the second verification lab.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your interviewing TA does not make decisions for learning objective completion. Do not pressure your TA into
                    marking you for completion. Likewise, your TA cannot tell you during the interview whether or not you
                    passed since they will not know. The course staff will weigh all evidence
                    while reviewing the reports from all TAs and efforts will be made to neutralize the variance between
                    TAs (i.e.
                    Your completion of learning objectives should not be affected by which TA you were assigned for an
                    interview).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Testing and Write - Programming Tasks x9</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are 9 learning objective programming tasks assigned throughout the semester, 6 of which will
                    involve writing code for functionality and 3 for writing unit tests. To complete the write portion
                    of the learning objectives, you must complete all 9 tasks <b>on time</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programming tasks will be introduced, and discussed, during the week of lecture where the
                    material needed to complete the task is covered. Each task is expected to be completed by the
                    Wednesday morning following the introduction of the material. You should always aim to complete the
                    task by this <em>expected</em> deadline. The actual deadline for each task will be the Wednesday
                    morning 2 weeks
                    after the material is covered. If you do not complete a task before it is due, you can no longer
                    earn credit for the write portion of the learning objective, and you will fail the class. This is to
                    prevent you from falling more than 2 weeks behind in this course. It is nearly impossible to
                    overcome a 2-week deficit in this course. Do your work early, stay up to date on the course, and
                    you will not have to worry about these deadlines.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Recovery Opportunities: </b>The grading policy, at least at first glance, is very harsh. If you miss
            any learning objective requirement, you fail the course. In reality, we understand that life happens. You
            might get sick, your car might break down on your way to lab, or you might have 4 midterms in 1 week and
            not have time to work on CSE116. To address this, the course already has 2 opportunities for each quiz
            and interview, and
            the deadline for each programming task has been extended by 1 week from the expected/reasonable deadline
            to effectively give you 2 chances for each requirement. For cases when 2
            opportunities are not enough, you can use recovery opportunities.</p>

        <p>
            You have 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdwyAcJ8j2U" class="non_visual_link">recovery opportunities</a>
            to use throughout the semester which can be used to earn another
            opportunity to complete a quiz, interview, or programming task. If you use a recovery opportunity for a
            Quiz or Interview, you can take the Quiz/Interview in lab the week after the second chance lab
            (Labelled "Recovery opportunity" on the course schedule. If you use a second recovery opportunity on a quiz
            or interview, we will schedule a makeup quiz or interview for you at a time outside of lab. If you use a
            recovery opportunity on a programming task, you will be given an additional 1-week extension on that task.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recovery opportunities cannot be used to extend the deadline of application objectives, nor to earn another
            chance for the quiz application objectives..
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Recovery opportunities will be used automatically if they are needed. Since the alternative is failing
                the course, we will assume that you want to use them if you don't complete a quiz/interview/task</li>
            <li>You can use multiple recovery opportunities on the same quiz/interview/task if needed</li>
        </ul>

                <li>
                    Each of the first 9 programming tasks (Only tasks related to Learning Objectives) has 2 deadlines.
                    The first is the expected deadline which is the time at which the course
                    staff expects a student who is putting in their 12 hours/week to complete the task. If this course
                    used standard percentage-based grading, this would be the only deadline. Since the consequences are
                    so harsh
                    for missing a single task (To ensure that you learn <b>all</b> of the material) the actual deadlines
                    have been extended by 1 week to give you ample time to study the material. However, to encourage you
                    to still meet the expected deadlines, you can earn application objectives by completing tasks before
                    these expected deadlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete at least 2 of the 9 programming tasks before their expected deadlines, you will
                    earn 1 application objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete at least 5 of the 9 programming tasks before their expected deadlines, you will
                    earn 2 application objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete at least 7 of the 9 programming tasks before their expected deadlines, you will
                    earn 3 application objectives.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Quizzes/Final Exam x6</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    On each of the 6 lab quizzes, you have the opportunity to earn an application objective.
                    To earn this application objective on a quiz, you must demonstrate a deep
                    understanding of the execution of the programs through your memory diagrams. Any mistake made
                    that is fundamental to the concepts being accessed with disqualify you from this application
                    objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can earn this application objective on the first 2 attempts of a quiz. You cannot earn the same
                    application objective more than once (ex. If you earn the application objective on the first chance
                    quiz, there's no benefit of taking the second chance for that same topic). You cannot earn this
                    application objective on any quiz attempt for which you used a recovery opportunity
                    (third+ attempt).
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will have a third opportunity to earn these application objectives on the final exam. The final
                    exam will contain memory diagram quiz-style questions for all 6 of the quiz topics. You only need
                    to take the sections of the exam for the quiz Application Objectives that you did not earn in the
                    first 2 attempts of the quiz. You cannot complete any Learning Objective requirements on the
                    final exam.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you earned all 6 application objectives on the quizzes, or if you already earned an A in
                    the course, there's no reason for you to take the final exam.
                </li>

            <li>Lecture Questions x2</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most lectures will include multiple choice questions to be answered during live lectures. These
                    will be simple
                    questions designed to encourage you to attend lecture and stay up to date on the material. Since
                    lectures will be recorded, there is a temptation to watch lecture days, or even weeks, after they
                    occur. These questions are to serve as an incentive for you to attend lecture and avoid falling
                    behind in the course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=60% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 1 application
                    objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer >=80% of the total available lecture question correctly, you will earn 2 application
                    objectives.

            In addition to the department and university policies, the following details apply to this course.
        </p>

        <p>
            All submitted work must be of your own creation, and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All violations will result in:

        <p>
            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of acceptable behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discussing an assignment with your classmates and brainstorming <b>abstract</b> solutions, then writing
                the code independently
            </li>
            <li>Forming study groups and discussing course material and assignments on Discord, Zoom, etc.</li>
            <li>Searching the Internet for supplementary material on the course topics</li>
            <li>Asking the teaching staff for clarification on a homework question</li>
            <li>Having, or hiring, someone to help you understand the concepts of the course</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
        </p>

            <li>Pressuring a TA to falsify an interview report.</li>
            <li>Submitting code, or other work, for course credit that is not your own.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with another student to write code for an assignment. <-- This is the most common type of violation. DO NOT write code together!</li>
            <li>Allowing another student to see your code or submission for an assignment.</li>
            <li>Allowing another student to access your work that will be submitted for course credit. (Examples: Do not
                post you code publicly, host your code in a public repository, or allow a classmate to access your
                laptop)</li>
            <li>Having someone help you write code.</li>
