        <p class="card-text">
            You know the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow,
            data structures, and file IO. With these concepts, you can train a computer
            to complete nearly any task you can imagine. So what's next?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Writing large programs</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            You will learn how to write and organize large pieces of software. To this end, in CSE116 you will study:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Program Execution</b></li>
            <li><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b></li>
            <li><b>Functional Programming</b></li>
            <li><b>Data Structures & Algorithms</b></li>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While studying these topics we will have a focus on <em>how</em> your programs work, not just
            <em>that</em> they work.

        <h3 class="card-title">Expectations</h3>
        <p class="card-text">
            This is not an easy course! To do well in this course you are expected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invest a minimum of <b>12 hours/week*</b> in CSE116 including at least 7 hours/week outside of class/lab
            </li>
            <li>Want to learn about computer science (This is assumed since you are taking a second CSE course)</li>
            <li>Be comfortable with the material from CSE115</li>
            <li>Participate in every lecture and lab (There will NOT be a lab during week 1)</li>
            <li>Have access to a computer with a reliable Internet connection</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            * The 12 hour/week minimum is an average. If you invest less than 12 hours/week in
            CSE116 during the first several weeks of the semester, or do not fully understand all the CSE115 topics,
            you should expect to work significantly more than
            12 hours/week while you catch up. You should expect to spend 40+ hours in a single week on this course
            alone if you fall behind or if you're not comfortable with the CSE115 material.
        </p>

        <p>
            If it is clear that you are working on this course for at least 12 hours/week, we will
            do whatever we can to ensure that you are successful in this course.

        <h3 class="card-title">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p>
            In CSE116 you will learn concepts related to the following 3 learning objectives. Being successful in CSE116
            requires completion of all 3 of these objectives. Each objective is divided into 3 parts:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li><b>Read</b> - Given a program related to the learning objective, trace through its execution and show
                what is stored in memory at every step. This will be assessed through quizzes during the learning
                objective verification labs. Every quiz will involve tracing through a memory diagram of several
                programs.</li>
            <li><b>Explain</b> - Communicate verbally about the concepts of the learning objective. You must demonstrate
                an understanding of these concepts, as well as comprehensive knowledge of the related terminology. This
                will be assessed through interviews during the learning objective verification labs</li>
            <li><b>Write</b> - Given a real-world problem statement, write a program that solves the problem. This will
                be assessed through the coding projects throughout the course. Each project will contain 3 tasks, all
                of which much be completed <b>on time</b> to complete the write portion of a learning objective.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Learning Objective 1 - Program Execution</h4>

        <p>
            In CSE115 there was a focus on writing programs to accomplish specific tasks. In CSE116
            we will focus on how those programs run. For program execution, we will study how memory is managed and
            how to automate the testing of programs.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read</b>: Trace through programs and track the state of stack memory throughout
                their execution using memory diagrams
            </li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Explain</b>: Describe the concepts of stack memory, stack frame, variable scoping,
                and unit testing, while reflecting on their importance in the programs we write</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write methods using Scala and write automated tests
                to verify the functionality of such methods</li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Learning Objective 2 - Object-Oriented Programming</h4>

        <p>
            Instead of writing programs as a collection of variables and functions, with object-oriented programming
            we will group
            these variables and functions into classes and objects. This allows developers to reason about their
            programs at a higher level of abstraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use inheritance and
                polymorphism while tracking the state of stack and heap memory using memory diagrams</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Explain</b>: Describe the concepts of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism and
                explain how they can be used to help us write software</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Implement programs that change behavior based on the type of an
                object stored in a variable by applying the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism
            </li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Learning Objective 3 - Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>

        <p>
            We will study several new approaches for storing data and computing with that data. Primarily, we will see
            linked-lists, trees, and graphs while exploring applications of each data structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use linked-lists, trees,
                and graphs using memory diagrams</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Explain</b>: Describe the structure of linked-lists, trees, and graphs and the
                implications of these structures including applications of each</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write programs that use linked-lists, trees, and graphs as well as
                implement new algorithms to expand the functionality of each data structure</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Learning Objective Completion</h4>

        <p>
            <b>
                You must demonstrate that you've completed all 3 learning objectives to pass this class.
            </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            You will have the following opportunities to demonstrate completion of the 3
            parts of each objective. Once you earn completion for all 3 parts, you have completed the
            corresponding learning objective.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Read - Lab Quiz</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each learning objective will include a code reading quiz that you will take during lab.
                    To complete the
                    read portion of a learning objective, your quiz submission must demonstrate that you can read code
                    as specified in the learning objective portion of the syllabus. All quizzes will require you to
                    complete a memory diagram for several programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These quizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis. If you pass the quiz, you have completed the read
                    portion of the learning
                    objective. All completion decisions will be made by a human after reviewing your submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are 2 lab quizzes on the schedule for each learning objective. If the course staff verifies
                    that you've completed the read portion of a learning objective after you take the first quiz, you do
                    not have to take the quiz during the second verification lab.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Explain - Lab Interview</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    During each learning objective verification lab, while you are taking your code reading quiz, you
                    will have a 10-minute interview with a TA. The TA may ask any
                    questions they deem appropriate in order to assess that you can explain the concepts
                    as specified in the learning objective portion of the syllabus.
                    The TA will submit a summary of your answers that will be reviewed
                    by the course staff.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As with the lab quizzes, the interviews are graded on a pass/fail basis. After human review of your
                    answers, it will be
                    decided whether or not you completed the explain portion of the learning objective through your
                    interview performance. If you complete the interview during the first learning objective verification lab,
                    you do not have to interview again during the second verification lab. (If you completed both the quiz
                    and interview during the first lab, you do not need to attend the second verification lab)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your interviewing TA does not make decisions for learning objective completion. Do not pressure your TA into
                    marking you for completion. Likewise, your TA cannot tell during the interview whether or not you
                    passed since they will not know. The course staff will weigh all evidence
                    while reviewing the reports from all TAs and efforts will be made to neutralize the variance between
                    TAs (i.e.
                    Your completion of learning objectives should not be affected by which TA you were assigned for an
                    interview).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Write - Coding Projects</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each learning objective will contain a program project with 3 weekly tasks to complete which
                    involve writing code. To complete the write portion of a learning objective, you must complete
                    all 3 tasks of the corresponding project <b>on time</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programming tasks will be introduced, and discussed, during lecture throughout the week where the
                    material needed to complete the task is covered. All tasks are due on Wednesday morning, 2 weeks
                    after the material is covered. If you do not complete a task before it is due, you can no longer
                    earn credit for the write portion of the learning objective, and you will fail the class. This is to
                    prevent you from falling more than 2 weeks behind in this course. It is nearly impossible to
                    overcome a 2-week deficit in this course. Do your work early, stay up to date on the course, and
                    you will not have to worry about these deadlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you earn credit for all required objectives in AutoLab you will have completed the
                    write portion of that learning objective. In rare cases, some objectives may
                    be waived after human review as long as you have demonstrated that you can write code
                    as specified in the learning objective portion of the syllabus (i.e. Do not stress about obscure
                    errors in your AutoLab feedback as long as you know your code works <b>and</b> you have comprehensive
                    unit testing. If your testing is anything less than amazing, do not expect a waiver).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Recovery Opportunities: </b>The grading policy, at least at first glance, seems very harsh. If you miss
            any part of a learning objective, you fail the course. In reality, we understand that life happens. You
            might get sick, your car might break down on your way to lab, or you might have 4 midterms in 1 week and
            not have time to work on CSE116. To address this, the course already has 2 opportunities for each quiz
            and interview, and
            the deadline for each programming task has been extended by 1 week from the expected/early/reasonable deadline
            (explained in the next section) to effectively give you 2 chances for each task. For cases when 2
            opportunities are not enough, you can use recovery opportunities.</p>

        <p>
            You have 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdwyAcJ8j2U" class="non_visual_link">recovery opportunities</a> to use throughout the semester which can be used to earn another
            opportunity to complete a quiz, interview, or programming task. If you use a recovery opportunity on a quiz
            or interview, we will schedule a makeup quiz or interview for you at a time outside of lab. If you use a
            recovery opportunity on a programming task, you will be given an additional 1-week extension on that task.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recovery opportunities cannot be used to extend the deadline of application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Recovery opportunities will be used automatically if they are needed. Since the alternative is failing
                the course, we will assume that you want to use them if you don't complete a quiz/interview/task</li>
            <li>If you have a legitimate, and documented, excuse for missing a lab or deadline (e.g. A doctors note
                saying you couldn't make it to lab), you will be given the makeup or extension
                without having to use one of your 4 recovery opportunities</li>
            <li>You can use multiple recovery opportunities on the same quiz/interview/task if needed (With the
                exception of the last few tasks. You cannot extend any task deadline past the Wednesday of finals
                week)</li>

        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            You can improve your letter grade by showing that you can <b>apply</b> the learning objectives to solve
            <b>real-world problems</b>. You will have the following opportunities to complete application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Programming Projects x3</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 3 learning objective projects will contain a 4th programming task that will be
                    labeled as an Application
                    Objective. If you complete the application objective before the deadline of the 3rd programming
                    task, you will earn an application objective in the course.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Programming Task Expected Deadlines x2</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each task has 2 deadlines. The first is the expected deadline which is the time at which the course
                    staff expects a student who is putting in their 12 hours/week to complete the task. If this course
                    used percentage-based grading, this would be the only deadline. Since the consequences are so harsh
                    for missing a single task (To ensure that you learn <b>all</b> of the material) the actual deadlines
                    have been extended by 1 week to give you ample time to study the material. However, to encourage you
                    to still meet the expected deadlines, you can earn application objectives by completing tasks before
                    these expected deadlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete at least 5 of the 9 tasks before their expected deadlines, you will earn 1
                    application objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete at least 7 of the 9 tasks before their expected deadlines, you will earn 2
                    application objectives.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>1st Quizzes/Final Exam x3</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    During the first verification quiz for each learning objective, you will have an opportunity to
                    earn an application objective. To earn this application objective, you must demonstrate a deep
                    understanding of the execution of the programs through your memory diagrams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You cannot earn this application objective on the second chance quizzes or on any makeup quizzes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will have a second opportunity to earn these application objectives on the final exam. The final
                    exam will contain memory diagram quiz-style questions for all 3 of the learning objectives and the exam
                    will be separated by learning objective. For any applications that you did not earn during the first
                    quiz, you can earn on the final exam (e.g., If you earned the application objective on the quiz for
                    learning objectives 2 and 3, then you don't have to do these portions of the final exam and you
                    would only complete learning objectives 1 on the final).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you earned all 3 application objectives on the quizzes, or if you already earned an A in
                    the course, there's no reason for you to take the final exam.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Lecture Questions x2</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Most lectures will include questions to be answered during live lectures. These will be simple
                    questions designed to encourage you to attend lecture and stay up to date on the material. Since
                    lectures will be recorded, there is a temptation to watch lecture days, or even weeks, after they
                    occur. These questions are to serve as an incentive for you to attend lecture and avoid falling
                    behind in the course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you earn >=60% of the total available lecture question points, you will earn 1 application objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you earn >=80% of the total available lecture question points, you will earn 2 application objectives.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

            In addition to the department and university policies, the following details apply to this course.
        </p>

        <p>
            All submitted work must be of your own creation and you must not share your submission with anyone else. If
            any submission is very similar to code that has been submitted by another student,
            or can be found online, it is in violation of this courses academic integrity policy and all students will
            be penalized whether they were copying or sharing their code with other students so they can copy. If two
            submissions are similar beyond what is likely if the students worked independently, then <b>both students
            are in violation</b> of the academic integrity policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All violations will result in:

        <p>
            It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes an academic integrity violation. If you have
            any question whether something you are doing is a violation or not, ask for
            clarification <b>before receiving an F in the course</b>. I will not entertain excuses after you
            have been caught.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of acceptable behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discussing an assignment with your classmates and brainstorming <b>abstract</b> solutions, then writing
                code independently
            </li>
            <li>Forming study groups and discussing course material and assignments on Discord, Zoom, etc.</li>
            <li>Searching the Internet for supplementary material on the course topics</li>
            <li>Asking the teaching staff for clarification on a homework question</li>
            <li>Having, or hiring, someone to help you understand the concepts of the course</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Examples of <b>un</b>acceptable behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pressuring a TA to falsify an interview report or application objective verification.</li>
            <li>Submitting code or other work, for course credit, that is not your own.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with another student to write code for an assignment. <-- This is the most common type of violation. DO NOT write code together!</li>
            <li>Allowing another student to see your code or submission for an assignment.</li>
            <li>Allowing another student to access your work that will be submitted for course credit. (Examples: Do not
                post you code publicly, host your code in a public repository, or allow a classmate to access your
                laptop)
            </li>
