        <p class="card-text">
            You know the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow,
            data structures, and file IO. With these concepts, you can train a computer
            to complete nearly any task you can imagine. So what's next?
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Writing large programs</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            You will learn how to write and organize large pieces of software. To this end, in CSE116 you will study:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Unit Testing</b></li>
            <li><b>Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b></li>
            <li><b>Data Structures & Algorithms</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While studying these topics we will have a focus on <em>how</em> your programs work, not just
            <em>that</em> they work.

        <h3 class="card-title">Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p>
            Being successful in CSE116 requires completion of all of the learning objective requirements.
            You must complete <b>every</b> Learning Objective requirement in order to pass CSE116.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning objectives are divided into 2 primary categories:
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Classes/Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h4>

        <p>
            Instead of writing programs as a collection of variables and functions, with object-oriented programming
            we will group
            these variables and functions into classes and objects. This allows developers to reason about their
            programs at a higher level of abstraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read/Quiz</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism while tracking the state of stack and heap memory using
                memory diagrams</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write and test programs that use classes,
                inheritance, and polymorphism
            </li>
        </ul>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>

        <p>
            We will study several new approaches for storing data and computing with that data. Primarily, we will see
            linked-lists, trees, and graphs while exploring applications of each data structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            A student has completed this objective if they are able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="objective">
            <li class="objective"><b>Read/Quiz</b>: Trace through the execution of programs that use linked-lists, trees,
                and graphs using memory diagrams</li>
            <li class="objective"><b>Write</b>: Write and test programs that use linked-lists, trees, and graphs as well as
                implement new algorithms to expand the functionality of each data structure</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You must demonstrate that you've completed all learning objectives to earn a passing grade in this
            class. To complete all learning objectives, you must complete a total of 6 memory diagram quizzes and 8
            programming assignments.
        </p>


        <hr/>
        <h4>Learning Objective Completion</h4>

        <p>
            <b>
                To complete the learning objectives of this course, you must complete all of the following requirements.
            </b>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Diagram Quizzes x6</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There will be 6 lab quiz requirements that must be completed throughout the semester. These
                    quizzes are labeled on the course schedule as:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Classes 1 - Classes</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 1 - Linked-Lists</li>
                    <li>Classes 2 - Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 2 - Trees</li>
                    <li>Classes 3 - Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Data Structures 3 - Graphs</li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Quizzes will be completed in the first hour of 3 specified lectures and will assess you ability to trace through
                    stack and heap memory during the execution of given code
                </li>
                <li>
                    These quizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis. If you pass the quiz, you have completed the
                    learning objective for that quiz. All completion decisions will be made by a human
                    after reviewing your submission. Each of these quizzes will cover 2 of the learning objectives and they will be graded independently
                </li>
                <li>
                    You must pass all 6 quizzes in order to pass the class. Any quiz that you did not pass, you will have a second chance to complete the quiz during the last lecture of the semester
                </li>
                <li>
                    If after both attempts, you have not completed all 6 quizzes, you will be given one last chance to complete upto 2 quizzes. These will be scheduled outside of lecture time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Programming Tasks x8</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are 8 programming tasks assigned throughout the semester. You must complete all 8 tasks to pass the course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programming tasks will be introduced, and discussed, during the lecture where the
                    material needed to complete the task is covered. Each task is expected to be completed by the
                    morning 1 week following the introduction of the material. You should always aim to complete the
                    task by this <em>expected</em> deadline. The actual deadline for each task is the day after the last day of classes.
                    If you do not complete all tasks before this deadline, you will fail the class. Do your work early, stay up to date on the course, and
                    you will not have to worry about this deadline.
                </li>

        <h4>Application Objectives</h4>

        <p>
            You can improve your letter grade by showing that you can <b>apply</b> the learning objectives to solve
            <b>real-world problems</b> in a timely manner. The objectives are primarily designed to encourage you to keep up with the material in this very fast-paced course.
            You will have the following opportunities to complete application objectives.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Programming Task Expected Deadlines x6</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each of the 8 programming tasks have an expected deadline which is the time at which the course
                    staff expects a student to complete the task. If this course
                    used standard percentage-based grading, this would be the only deadline. Since the consequences are
                    so harsh
                    for missing a single task (To ensure that you learn <b>all</b> of the material) the actual deadlines
                    have been extended to the day after the last day of class to give you ample time to study the material. However, to encourage you
                    to still meet the expected deadlines, you can earn application objectives by completing tasks before
                    these expected deadlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each time you complete a programming task before the expected deadline, you will
                    earn 1 application objective upto a max of 6 application objectives.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Quizzes x4</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Since you must complete all 6 quizzes to pass the class, you will have 2 opportunities to complete
                    each quiz. As an incentive to stay current with the material of the course, and not fall behind,
                    you can earn application objectives by completing the quizzes on the first attempt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each time you complete a quiz on the first attempt, you will
                    earn 1 application objective upto a max of 4 application objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you complete all 6 quizzes on the first attempt, there's no reason for you to attend the last day of class.
